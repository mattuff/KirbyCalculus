KirPy is a Python Package for Kirby Calculus!

Kirby diagrams are a way of modeling 4-manifolds based off of their handlebody decomposition. The Kirby class takes planar diagrams as inputs, and can perform all the Kirby moves on the diagram: Reidemeister moves, handle annihilation and creation, and handle slides.
